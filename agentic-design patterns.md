# Agentic AI Design Patterns
## Comprehensive Guide to Building effective Agents with Examples with CrewAi

Agentic AI represents a design philosophy rather than a single technology. Whether you call your system a “workflow” or an “agent,” the key idea is that a large language model (LLM) is used not simply to answer a single query but to *drive a process*—making decisions, invoking tools, and even iterating over its own outputs. In this guide, we explore every major design pattern found in recent research and articles (Anthropic’s [Building Effective Agents](https://www.anthropic.com/research/building-effective-agents), Muslum Yildiz’s insights, and the Agents Decoded analysis) and demonstrate how to implement each pattern using CrewAI.

> **Note:** Although the original research and commentary sometimes use overlapping terminology, we distinguish between “workflows” (predefined, step-by-step processes) and truly autonomous “agents” (systems that self-direct via iterative reasoning and tool use). Our examples below cover both and explain when to use one approach versus the other.

## 1. Introduction to Agentic AI

### What Are Agentic Systems?

- **Agentic Systems:** Any system where an LLM is empowered to make decisions and choose tools dynamically. These systems may:
  - Plan multi-turn actions.
  - Interact with external APIs or tools.
  - Adapt its behavior based on environmental feedback.
  
- **Workflows vs. Agents:**
  - **Workflows:** Follow a predetermined sequence of steps. They are predictable and easier to debug.
  - **Agents:** Are more autonomous—they decide their own path based on inputs and feedback. This autonomy increases flexibility but may introduce higher latency and cost.

### Why Use Agentic Design Patterns?

- **Flexibility:** For open-ended or complex tasks (e.g., customer support, coding assistance), an autonomous agent can plan and iterate.
- **Performance Trade-Offs:** Simpler systems may work well for one-off tasks, but when the task demands iterative reasoning (and error recovery), more advanced patterns become necessary.
- **Modularity:** Breaking the problem into patterns (like routing, parallelization, orchestration, etc.) allows you to combine and customize behavior according to your use case.

## 2. Building Blocks: The Augmented LLM

At the core of every agentic system is the **augmented LLM**. This is an LLM enhanced with:
- **Retrieval:** The ability to query external data.
- **Tool Use:** Direct invocation of external services or APIs.
- **Memory:** The capacity to remember context over multiple turns.

### CrewAI Initialization

Using CrewAI, you start by initializing an agent that has these augmented capabilities. For example:

```python
import crewai

# Initialize a CrewAI agent with your API key and model settings.
agent = crewai.Agent(api_key="YOUR_API_KEY", model="claude-3-sonnet")
```

This simple initialization sets up the basis for every design pattern described below.

## 3. Agentic Design Patterns

Below are the primary design patterns for building agentic systems. Each pattern has its use case, benefits, and potential trade-offs.

### 3.1 Prompt Chaining

**Concept:**  
Break a complex task into a series of simpler subtasks, each handled by a separate LLM call. The output of one call feeds into the next.

**When to Use:**  
- Tasks that can naturally be divided into sequential steps (e.g., content creation, document summarization).

**Example:**  
Generate a marketing copy, then translate it into another language.

**CrewAI Implementation Example:**

```python
def generate_outline(task_description):
    prompt = f"Create a detailed outline for a marketing campaign that {task_description}."
    return agent.call(prompt).strip()

def generate_copy(outline):
    prompt = f"Using this outline:\n{outline}\nGenerate a creative marketing copy."
    return agent.call(prompt).strip()

def translate_copy(copy_text, target_language="Spanish"):
    prompt = f"Translate the following marketing copy into {target_language}:\n{copy_text}"
    return agent.call(prompt).strip()

# Usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    task = "boosts brand awareness for a new eco-friendly product"
    outline = generate_outline(task)
    copy_text = generate_copy(outline)
    final_output = translate_copy(copy_text)
    print("Final Output:\n", final_output)
```

---

### 3.2 Routing

**Concept:**  
Classify the input and route it to the appropriate specialized process or sub-agent. This allows handling multiple types of inputs effectively.

**When to Use:**  
- Customer service systems where different queries require different processing (e.g., refunds, technical support).


**CrewAI Implementation Example:**

```python
def classify_query(query):
    prompt = f"Classify the following customer query into one of these categories: Refund, Technical Support, General Inquiry.\nQuery: {query}"
    return agent.call(prompt).strip()

def handle_refund(query):
    prompt = f"Process a refund request for the following query:\n{query}"
    return agent.call(prompt).strip()

def handle_support(query):
    prompt = f"Provide technical support advice for the following query:\n{query}"
    return agent.call(prompt).strip()

# Usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    query = "I was charged twice for my subscription. I need a refund."
    category = classify_query(query)
    if "Refund" in category:
        result = handle_refund(query)
    else:
        result = handle_support(query)
    print("Response:\n", result)
```

### 3.3 Parallelization

**Concept:**  
Execute multiple subtasks simultaneously and aggregate their outputs. Two key variants include:

- **Sectioning:** Divide the task into independent sections processed in parallel.
- **Voting:** Run multiple instances for the same task and then choose the best answer.

**When to Use:**  
- Tasks where speed is critical or where obtaining diverse perspectives improves accuracy (e.g., code review, content evaluation).

**CrewAI Implementation Example:**

```python
import concurrent.futures

def run_subtask(prompt):
    return agent.call(prompt).strip()

def parallel_sectioning(task_description):
    prompts = [
        f"Analyze the following task for feasibility: {task_description}",
        f"Identify potential pitfalls for the task: {task_description}",
        f"Suggest improvements for the task: {task_description}"
    ]
    results = []
    with concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor() as executor:
        futures = [executor.submit(run_subtask, p) for p in prompts]
        for future in concurrent.futures.as_completed(futures):
            results.append(future.result())
    # Combine results (this can be as simple as joining strings or more complex aggregation)
    return "\n".join(results)

# Usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    task = "Develop an automated file backup system with error handling"
    aggregated_result = parallel_sectioning(task)
    print("Aggregated Results:\n", aggregated_result)
```

### 3.4 Orchestrator-Workers

**Concept:**  
A central orchestrator LLM decomposes a complex task into subtasks and delegates each to worker LLMs. It then synthesizes the outputs into a final answer.

**When to Use:**  
- Complex, multi-step problems such as large-scale code refactoring or research summarization across multiple sources.


**CrewAI Implementation Example:**

```python
def orchestrate_task(task_description):
    # Orchestrator: decompose task
    decomposition_prompt = f"Decompose the following task into three subtasks:\n{task_description}"
    subtasks = agent.call(decomposition_prompt).strip().split("\n")
    
    # Delegate each subtask to a worker
    worker_results = []
    for subtask in subtasks:
        worker_prompt = f"Perform the following subtask:\n{subtask}"
        worker_results.append(agent.call(worker_prompt).strip())
    
    # Synthesize the results
    synthesis_prompt = "Synthesize the following results into a coherent final solution:\n" + "\n".join(worker_results)
    return agent.call(synthesis_prompt).strip()

# Usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    complex_task = "Refactor a multi-module Python project to improve performance and readability."
    final_solution = orchestrate_task(complex_task)
    print("Final Synthesized Output:\n", final_solution)
```

---

### 3.5 Evaluator-Optimizer

**Concept:**  
Establish a feedback loop where one LLM generates a response and another evaluates it. The feedback is then used to iteratively optimize the output.

**When to Use:**  
- Tasks that benefit from iterative refinement, such as translations or code improvements.

**CrewAI Implementation Example:**

```python
def generate_initial_response(task_description):
    prompt = f"Provide an initial solution for the following task:\n{task_description}"
    return agent.call(prompt).strip()

def evaluate_response(response):
    prompt = f"Evaluate the following response. Provide feedback on how it can be improved:\n{response}"
    return agent.call(prompt).strip()

def optimize_response(response, feedback):
    prompt = f"Here is a response:\n{response}\nFeedback: {feedback}\nRefine the response accordingly."
    return agent.call(prompt).strip()

# Usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    task = "Translate a complex technical document from English to French."
    initial = generate_initial_response(task)
    feedback = evaluate_response(initial)
    optimized = optimize_response(initial, feedback)
    print("Optimized Output:\n", optimized)
```

### 3.6 Autonomous Agents

**Concept:**  
Fully autonomous agents use multi-turn interactions, external tool calls, and error recovery. They begin with a user command, plan their actions, execute tasks (e.g., interacting with APIs or even controlling a computer), and seek human feedback when needed.

**When to Use:**  
- Open-ended problems where the number of steps isn’t fixed, such as a coding agent that autonomously resolves GitHub issues or a support agent that manages complex customer interactions.

**CrewAI Implementation Example:**

```python
def autonomous_coding_agent(task_description, max_iterations=5):
    # Autonomous agent loop: plan, execute, and check results.
    current_state = f"Task: {task_description}\n"
    for iteration in range(max_iterations):
        # Step 1: Plan next action
        plan_prompt = f"Based on the current state:\n{current_state}\nPlan the next step to complete the task."
        plan = agent.call(plan_prompt).strip()
        
        # Step 2: Execute action (simulate tool/API call)
        execute_prompt = f"Execute the following planned action and provide the result:\n{plan}"
        result = agent.call(execute_prompt).strip()
        
        # Step 3: Update state and decide if further action is needed
        current_state += f"\nPlan: {plan}\nResult: {result}\n"
        decision_prompt = f"Based on the current state:\n{current_state}\nShould the agent continue (type CONTINUE) or stop (type STOP) if the task is complete? Explain briefly."
        decision = agent.call(decision_prompt).strip().lower()
        if "stop" in decision:
            break
    return current_state

# Usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    task = "Fix bugs in a Python project by analyzing GitHub issues and updating the code."
    final_state = autonomous_coding_agent(task)
    print("Autonomous Agent Final State:\n", final_state)
```

## 4. Best Practices and Considerations

When designing agentic AI systems:
- **Start Simple:** Use a single LLM call with retrieval or in-context examples when possible.
- **Iterate Gradually:** Only add complexity (multi-turn loops, orchestration, evaluator-optimizer loops) when measurable improvements justify it.
- **Maintain Transparency:** Explicitly log or display the agent’s planning steps to aid debugging and build trust.
- **Robust Tooling:** Invest time in designing clear tool interfaces and comprehensive documentation.
- **Test in Sandbox:** Always test autonomous agents in controlled environments to avoid unintended actions or errors.

---

## 5. Combining Patterns for Complex Systems

Real-world applications may require combining several patterns. For example:
- **Routing + Orchestration:** First classify a customer query, then use an orchestrator to delegate subtasks (e.g., gathering data, updating records).
- **Evaluator-Optimizer within Autonomous Loops:** Use continuous feedback within a long-running autonomous agent to ensure high-quality outputs.
- **Parallelization + Voting:** Run several candidate solutions in parallel and select the best based on a voting mechanism.

CrewAI can be extended and combined in similar ways by modularizing your code functions and linking their outputs.

---

## 6. Practical Implementation Summary with CrewAI

By leveraging CrewAI, you can quickly prototype each agentic design pattern:
- **Initialization:** Set up your augmented LLM.
- **Design Patterns:** Implement each pattern (chaining, routing, parallelization, orchestration, evaluation, full autonomy) as modular functions.
- **Combination:** Compose these functions to build complex, real-world systems.

The sample code snippets provided above illustrate how each pattern works. With a robust logging mechanism and clear feedback channels, you can iterate and optimize your agentic systems for production use.

---

## 7. Conclusion

Agentic AI design patterns enable you to build systems that go far beyond single-turn queries. By carefully selecting and combining workflows such as prompt chaining, routing, parallelization, orchestrator-workers, evaluator-optimizer loops, and fully autonomous agents, you can solve complex tasks while maintaining control and transparency.

Using CrewAI as a framework, you can implement these patterns with minimal code and rapid iteration. Remember:
- **Prioritize simplicity**—start small, measure performance, then add complexity as needed.
- **Design for transparency**—make the agent’s reasoning visible.
- **Iterate and test**—ensure that every addition improves the overall system.

With these principles and patterns, you’re well on your way to building powerful, agentic AI systems that meet real-world challenges.
